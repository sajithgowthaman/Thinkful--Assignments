1) Write a query that allows you to inspect the schema of the naep table.

SELECT data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'naep';

2) Write a query that returns the first 50 records of the naep table.

SELECT *
FROM naep LIMIT 50;

3) Write a query that returns summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state. Make sure to sort the results alphabetically by state name.

SELECT AVG(avg_math_4_score), COUNT(avg_math_4_score), MIN(avg_math_4_score), MAX(avg_math_4_score)
FROM naep
GROUP BY naep.state
ORDER BY naep.state ASC;

4) Write a query that alters the previous query so that it returns only the summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state with differences in max and min values that are greater than 30.


SELECT AVG(avg_math_4_score), COUNT(avg_math_4_score), MIN(avg_math_4_score), MAX(avg_math_4_score)
FROM naep
GROUP BY naep.state
HAVING MAX(avg_math_4_score) - MIN(avg_math_4_score) > 30
ORDER BY naep.state ASC;

5)Write a query that returns a field called bottom_10_states that lists the states in the bottom 10 for avg_math_4_score in the year 2000.

SELECT state AS bottom_10_states
FROM naep
WHERE YEAR = 2000
AND avg_math_4_score IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY avg_math_4_score DESC
LIMIT 10;

6) Write a query that calculates the average avg_math_4_score rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places over all states in the year 2000.

SELECT ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score),2)
FROM naep 
WHERE YEAR = 2000;

7) Write a query that returns a field called below_average_states_y2000 that lists all states with an avg_math_4_score less than the average over all states in the year 2000.

WITH average_2000 AS 
  (
   SELECT
   naep.state AS states,
   AVG(avg_math_4_score) AS averages
   FROM naep 
   WHERE naep.year = 2000 
   GROUP BY naep.state
)

SELECT states AS below_average_states_y2000 
FROM average_2000
WHERE averages < (SELECT AVG(avg_math_4_score) 
FROM naep 
WHERE naep.year = 2000);

8) Write a query that returns a field called scores_missing_y2000 that lists any states with missing values in the avg_math_4_score column of the naep data table for the year 2000.

SELECT state as scores_missing_y2000
from naep
where year = 2000 AND avg_math_4_score IS NULL;

9) Write a query that returns for the year 2000 the state, avg_math_4_score, and total_expenditure 
from the naep table left outer joined with the finance table, using id as the key and ordered by total_expenditure greatest to least. 
Be sure to round avg_math_4_score to the nearest 2 decimal places, and then filter out NULL avg_math_4_scores in order to see any correlation more clearly.

SELECT naep.state, (ROUND(avg_math_4_score),2) AS AVG_MATH_4_SCORE, finance.total_expenditure
FROM naep LEFT OUTER JOIN finance
ON naep.id=finance.id
WHERE naep.year = 2000
AND avg_math_4_score IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY finance.total_expenditure DESC;
